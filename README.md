# cafe-bill-management-system
This is Cafe Bill Management System.
I have done this project to gain more knowledge in Django generic views and other Django functionalities and I also want to explore my skills in javascript and CSS but being 
honest I am not interested in javascript and CSS 
I am the only interested to do code in Django and python and to implement logic in my project
Through this project, I have learned many things
I have not used the advanced functionalities of Django in this project
But I will add in future


My Project Link: http://cafabillmanagementsystem.pythonanywhere.com/

It is available with the admin panel

If you want to go to the admin panel then Double click on "Created By" which place in the top right corner of the home page

In the admin panel, you have all access to the menu items

And yes I have also added a button on the home page which name is the edit page
you can edit your page through this button
